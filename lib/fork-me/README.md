## Getting started:

Click on the `"Use this template"` button to customize it for your next JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Vue/Next.js library or project.

## What's Different?

Compared to the default scaffold from create-turbo, this template offers:

- Unit tests with `vitest`
- Build setup with `tsup` and `esbuild-react18-useclient` Supports React Server components out of the box
- **Automatic file generation**
  - just run `yarn turbo gen` and follow the prompts to auto generate your new component with test file and dependency linking
  - follow best practices automatically
- GitHub actions/workflows to auto publish your package when version changes
- GitHub action/workflow + preinstall scripts to automatically rebrand your repo on creation
